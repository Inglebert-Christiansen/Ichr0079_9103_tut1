## Quiz 8 Pacita Abad's Wheel of Fortune
### **Part 1 Imaging technique inspiration**
I have selected Pacita Abad's *Wheel of Fortune* as my artwork. After some research, I decided to take inspiration from the mirror dimension in the Doctor Strange movie. The mirror dimension uses geometrical shapes to create kaleidoscopic circles and patterns inspired by mathematical equations, and from my observations, the artwork I chose can also be broken down into two main parts, the circle and the pattern. Tying that into what I have learned in class, I think it would be interesting to consider the formula and functions to create the illusion of moving patterns in an array of circles.

### **Part 2 Coding Technique Exploration**

 To recreate the mirror dimension in P5.js, we can create a kaleidoscope effect by using translate(), rotate(), and scale().

- translate() : we can begin with a central object and use translate to shift the   origin.

- rotate() : We can use rotate to mimic the fractal-like folding in the movie.

- Scale() : flip elements, creating reflections of objects often seen in a kaleidoscope.

By combining these principles with design compositions, I think it is possible to create the illusion of endlessly shifting geometric shapes, while it wonâ€™t be as complex as the movie, it will still look interesting.
