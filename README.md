### **Part 1 Imaging technique inspiration**
After some searching, I decided to take inspiration from the mirror dimension in the Doctor strange movie from the marvel cinematic universe. I believe it is a challenging concept that would be exciting to implement because it uses geometrical equations such as the Archimedes spiral to create visuals that are almost kaleidoscopic. From what I have learned in the class so far, creating generative artworks often require mathematical equations and the best artworks are often inspired by the patterns we see in the real world and that is why I think this would be a great approach to consider.

### **Part 2 Coding Technique Exploration**

 To recreate the mirror dimension in P5.js, we can create a kaleidoscope effect by using translate(), rotate(), and scale().

- translate() : we can begin with a central object and use translate to shift the   origin.

- rotate() : We can use rotate to mimic the fractal-like folding in the movie.

- Scale() : flip elements, creating reflections of objects often seen in a kaleidoscope.

By combining these principles with design compositions, I think it is possible to create the illusion of endlessly shifting geometric shapes, while it wonâ€™t be as complex as the movie, it will still look interesting.
